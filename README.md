### Instructions
You will be redirecting http/https requests from the tutorial level to my custom level.
_(This, however, also works with any json that you may want to redirect to)_

How to use:
1. Install the [Requestly](https://requestly.io/blog/2018/04/07/install-requestly-in-chrome-and-firefox/) extension/add-on onto either Firefox or Chrome
2. Create Redirect Request Rule (as shown below)
![Requestly](https://github.com/DeLaPF/FBWG-PSPACE-Complete/blob/master/images/Requestly.png)
3. Click on _Save Rule_  
4. Open Fireboy & Watergirl in a new tab and select the tutorial level  
  _(this should work for any website that has FBWG, however you can use this [link](https://html5-games.io/game/fireboy-and-watergirl/) to be sure)_  
6. You're done!!! The custom level should be up and running for you to test

### Additional Information
As I alluded to prior, it is entirely possible for you to upload your own custom levels using this same method; all that is required for you to do so is to upload your own .json file to GitHub or any other place where you will be able to link to your file, and replace the redirect Destination with the URL to your own .json FBWG level.
The json file is relatively straightforward as is, though there are other usable objects not included in my .json, so I can make a guide on how to use it if someone raises an issue and needs help.
